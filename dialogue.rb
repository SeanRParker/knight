# Beginning
"You wake up in the woods in the afternoon, with a huge headache."

"'What is your name?' A loud voice yells from nearby."

input name

"Why hello sir #{name}? May I challenge you to a duel?"
  "But, I'm a lady."
    - "Oh, sorry, lady #{name}, may I challenge you to a duel?"
  "Why are we fighting?"
  X  - "You are trespassing on the king's hunting grounds. I'm a knight, I'm supposed to kill anyone who commits crimes against the king's property, but I like to give my foe a sporting chance."
  "No. I refuse to fight you."
    - Knight kills you anyway.

Knight points at a table with three items. A dagger, a stick, a sword.
  Pick dagger
    - He grazes you with the sword, but you manage to injure him enough that he yields.
  Pick stick
    - Are you kidding me? A stick?
    - You thump his armor and slightly annoy him. The knight cleaves you in two with one great swoop.
    death module
  Pick sword
    - You win, unscathed, apparently your years of watching violent tv shows have equipped you for the horrors of war.

Sir Jabsalot kneels prostrate before you. "I yield. If you let me live, I'll take you to the nearest town."
  X Let him live
    "Sure. I could use the help, I don't know where I am"
    Sir Jabsalot tells you, "Walk that way for 100 paces, there'll be a road. Follow it to the right for two miles and you'll be in town." You trust him and end up in town.
  Kill him
    "I can find my own way." (This option keeps you lost and you can't find the way. You eventually die of starvation. embarassing messages ensue)
    death module
  X Steal his horse and sword.
    "I'll let you live, but I'm taking these." (You proceed to take Sir Jabsalot's horse and sword) The horse leads you to the nearest town, because horse's are smart, and that's where he happens to stable. Once at the stable he refuses to go anywhere else with you, but at least you're in town.


  You're in town and ask the locals where the nearest pub is "Ye Olde Inn" (how cliche).

  Options 1) Have a pint.
          2) That's enough. (after 3 drinks, you get drunk and pass out. If you stop before then, you win.)
